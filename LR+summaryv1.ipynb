            "Alright, I've got this query from a user who is a data analyst. They provided a linear regression output and want a professional summary based on that. Let me start by understanding what they need.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, I need to look at the regression output. It includes coefficients for various predictors, an intercept, R-squared, and MSE. My task is to extract key predictors and their coefficients, include R-squared and MSE, interpret the model fit, and find any interesting insights.\n",
            "\n",
            "I should start by identifying the key predictors. Looking at the coefficients, some are positive and some are negative. The user probably wants to know which variables have the most impact, both positive and negative. So I'll list the top few from each category.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, I need to explain the R-squared and MSE. R-squared is about 0.52, which means the model explains over half the variance. That's moderate, not too strong but decent. MSE is 37, which I guess is the units of the dependent variable. I should mention that lower MSE is better but also consider the context.\n",
            "\n",
            "Interpreting the model fit, I'll note that R-squared is moderate, so there's still some variance unexplained. Maybe mention that other factors or nonlinear relationships could be at play.\n",
            "\n",
            "For insights, I'll highlight the significant predictors. For example, organic SEO non-brand clicks have a strong positive coefficient, which is good for the business. Video conversion spend is also positive. On the flip side, some brand tracker metrics are negative, which might indicate issues with brand perception. COVID Q2 has a positive coefficient, suggesting recovery. The negative coefficient for orders_all_np is interesting and might need further investigation.\n",
            "\n",
            "I should structure the summary clearly, maybe in sections like key predictors, model fit, insights, and recommendations. Keep it professional but concise, making sure to explain each part without getting too technical.\n",
            "\n",
            "I also need to make sure I'm accurate with the coefficients and their interpretations. For example, the brand tracker with a coefficient of -169 has a big impact, so that's a key point. The positive coefficient for VideoConversionPMAX_spend suggests that spending here is effective.\n",
            "\n",
            "I should avoid jargon and make it accessible, but still detailed enough for a professional audience. The user likely needs this summary for a report or presentation, so clarity is key.\n",

            "   - However, the positive coefficient for **covid_Q2_22** (1.8175) suggests some recovery or positive movement in Q2 2022.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Brand Perception**:  \n",
            "   - Several brand-related metrics, such as **brand_tracker_gen_pop_describes_xxxx_aligns_values_lag_2qtr** (-169.51196852) and **brand_tracker_gen_pop_describes_xxxx_brand_trust_lag_1qtr** (-101.10184369), have large negative coefficients.  \n",
            "   - This suggests that negative perceptions of the brand (e.g., alignment with values, brand trust) have a significant adverse effect on the dependent variable.  \n",
            "   - Conversely, **brand_tracker_gen_pop_describes_xxxx_proud_to_use_lag_1qtr** has a positive coefficient (53.355045), indicating that pride in using the brand positively influences the dependent variable.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Marketing Channels**:  \n",
            "   - **organic_seo_non_brand_clicks** has a strong positive coefficient (0.00419276), highlighting the importance of organic, non-brand search traffic in driving the dependent variable.  \n",
            "   - **VideoConversionPMAX_spend** and **VideoConversion_spend** also have positive coefficients, suggesting that investments in video conversion and PMAX spending are effective in increasing the dependent variable.  \n",
            "   - However, **orders_all_np** has a negative coefficient (-0.00025746), indicating that an increase in orders is associated with a small decrease in the dependent variable, which may warrant further investigation.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Customer Behavior Metrics**:  \n",
            "   - **gcr_per_order_overall_dom_registration_avg_7d** (0.25802446) and **gcr_per_order_overall_o365_avg_7d** (0.42667612) have positive coefficients, suggesting that higher average GCR (Gross Conversion Rate) per order for domain registration and Office 365 products is associated with an increase in the dependent variable.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Recommendations:\n",
            "- **Further Investigation**: Investigate the negative relationship between **orders_all_np** and the dependent variable to understand the underlying cause.  \n",
            "- **Brand Management**: Address negative brand perceptions, particularly around alignment with values and brand trust, as these have a significant adverse impact on the dependent variable.  \n",
            "- **Marketing Optimization**: Increase investments in organic SEO non-brand clicks and video conversion spending, as these channels show strong positive relationships with the dependent variable.  \n",
            "- **Model Improvement**: Consider adding additional predictors or exploring non-linear relationships to improve the model's explanatory power (R-squared).\n"
