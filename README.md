# bli_academy_chatbot
**Building a chatbot with an agentic framework, with data analysis and code-generation using LLM capabilities.**

Following is the process flow for Chatbot-based Data Analysis System:

1. **Data Input**:Users upload data in CSV/JSON format or connect via SQL queries or BigQuery.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: AI agents preprocess the data for further analysis.
3. **Data Analysis**:Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and visualizations are generated using the preprocessed data.
4. **Modeling**: The preprocessed dataset is used to generate and test a linear regression model with the help of an LLM.
5. **Output**: The final results, including summaries and reports, are provided to the user.
